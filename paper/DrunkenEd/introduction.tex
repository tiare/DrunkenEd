\drunkened\ is a 2D balance game specifically designed for public displays. The player stands in front of a large display and is tracked by a Kinect. By bending his or her own upper body, the player steers a drunkyard called \textit{\ed}. The goal of the game is to walk as far as possible without falling down. While the time passes, the difficulty increases contineously. So the player has to keep the balance to not fall down, but at the same time, he or she has to hurry because it is getting harder and harder to increase the walked distance.\\
One key element of the visuals is the rotating camera: many balance games keep the world static while letting the player balance an object. In this game, the opposite is the case: it is the world around the figure, which needs to be balanced with respect to the upper body.
