\section{Drunken Ed - Instruction manual}

A Kinect must be connected to the PC. To start the game, execute \textit{drunken\_ed.jar}. The title screen appears. To play the game, position yourself in front of the Kinect with a distance of about two meters. To control \ed\ lean yourself to the left or to the right, respectively. Move \ed\ to a drink and select it by doing a drink gesture, i.e. moving your right hand to your mouth. After a countdown, the main game starts. Try to move \ed\ to the right as far as possible without him falling down, again by leaning to the left or to the right respectively.
